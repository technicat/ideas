Whenever I tell someone I'm an app developer, they invariable have some great app idea they insist on telling me (even when I say "Don't tell me your app idea"), and then expect a big check in the future when I implement their idea, as if I didn't have a long list of my own vague and unoriginal ideas.

So, again, don't tell me your app idea, and if you do, it's going in this list of ideas that I will probably never get around to, and even if I do, if you can do a better job implementing it, go for it!
