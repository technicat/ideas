## App Ideas

- An Uber of apartment moving.
- An Uber of (fill in the blank).
- A Lyft of (fill in the blank). Just like the Uber of, but with a less sordid corporate history.
- Call blocking based on area codes (most of my spam calls are from a place I lived in ten years ago).
- A mobile version of Nendo (a 3D modeler with a minimal user interface). Touch screen would be great for rotations, extrusion, etc. and also 3D paint.
- A comic book authoring system, something that supports more than just reproducing the static pages of a regular comic books, i.e. audio, video...(there used to be a slick Unity-based package, and I know Bay Raitt was working on a VR comic book system).
- A shopping list/search which you can easily add to via camera, using AI classification, bar code, QR code, or I suppose you could just type something.
- Pill reminder.
- Lie detector (could be a game, too).
- Business cards on your phone, like a rolodex (remember those?). I originally envisioned being able to beam your business card from yoir PalmPilot (remember those?).
- A sushi app. like my dim sum app, but with sushi and Japanese instead of dim sum and Chinese.
- A ramen app, like my dim sum app...you get the idea.
- Panoramic interior views for virtual home walkthroughs (I thought of this back in the late 90s, so the ship has sailed on this one, but still, there's always room for better rendering...).
- A home finance app. I just want to see at a glance how much to price my home so I don't regret buying it in the first place, say, ranging from "I should have put that mone in stock" to "I'm a financially diversified genius!".
- Bathroom finder. With ratings.
