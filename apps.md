## App Ideas

- An Uber of apartment moving.
- An Uber of (fill in the blank).
- A Lyft of (fill in the blank). Just like the Uber of, but with a less sordid corporate history.
- Call blocking based on area codes (most of my spam calls are from a place I lived in ten years ago).
- A mobile version of Nendo (a 3D modeler with a minimal user interface). Touch screen would be great for rotations, extrusion, etc. and also 3D paint.
- A comic book authoring system, something that supports more than just reproducing the static pages of a regular comic books, i.e. audio, video...(there used to be a slick Unity-based package, and I know Bay Raitt was working on a VR comic book system).
- A shopping list which you can easily add to via camera (using AI classification, of course...), bar code, or I suppose you could just type something.
- Pill reminder.
