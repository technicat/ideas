## App Ideas

- An Uber of apartment moving.
- An Uber of (fill in the blank).
- Call blocking based on area codes (most of my spam calls are from a place I lived in ten years ago).
- A mobile version of Nendo (a 3D modeler with a minimal user interface).
- A comic book authoring system, something that supports more than just reproducing the static pages of a regular comic books, i.e. audio, video...(there used to be a slick Unity-based package, and I know Bay Raitt was working on a VR comic book system).
- Another Angry Birds (I don't know what's different, but I assume it wouldn't be called Angry Birds).
- Chess with 3D animations (I'm thinking Battle Chess, I'm sure there are others, but the last one I played was Battle Chess).
- Chinese chess (I probably don't remember completely how to play, but if you like chess, you'll like Chinese chess. Not to be confused with Chinese checkers).
- An RPG for language instruction - go out and buy/barter weapons, assemble a team, etc. in a foreign land with a foreign language (just like I had to figure out how to order food in the company cafeteria when I worked in Hong Kong).
- A game where you try to pass interview code quizzes, so you can get a job where you give interview code quizzes. Maybe throw in some office politics and useless stock options to make it interesting.
