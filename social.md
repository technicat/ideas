## Social Media

- LinkedIn, but project-based instead of company-based, so you link with project collaborators instead of company colleagues.
- An app where instead of starting off with the feed of the world jammed down your throat, you start off with everyone blocked, and you invite people into your circle (or circles). Like how Facebook started out, but without the turning evil part. And more blocking, who cares about number of likes, I want to see number of blocks, see (and copy) a person's block list, recursively block someone and their followers and their followers...
