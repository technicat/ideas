## Game Ideas

- A Bass Pro fishing game (I don't remember any details of this proposition, but I'm pretty sure getting a Bass Pro license is the important part).
- Another port of HyperBowl (I do have the license for that).
- Online multiplayer HyperBowl (an artist told me he could help and sent me a screenshot of a menu screen with a Multiplayer button added).
- HyperBowl racing.
- Another Angry Birds (I don't know what's different, but I assume it wouldn't be called Angry Birds).
- Chess with 3D animations (I'm thinking Battle Chess, I'm sure there are others, but the last one I played was Battle Chess).
- Chinese chess (I probably don't remember completely how to play, but if you like chess, you'll like Chinese chess. Not to be confused with Chinese checkers).
- An RPG for language instruction - go out and buy/barter weapons, assemble a team, etc. in a foreign land with a foreign language (just like I had to figure out how to order food in the company cafeteria when I worked in Hong Kong).
- A game where you try to pass interview code quizzes, so you can get a job where you give interview code quizzes. Maybe throw in some office politics and useless stock options to make it interesting.
- A cat cafe game. I know there's already one or more, but there could be different angles, like how to approach a cat without getting bit or scratched, or perhaps a cat's viewpoint.
