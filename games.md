## Game Ideas

- A Bass Pro fishing game (I don't remember any details of this proposition, but I'm pretty sure getting a Bass Pro license is the important part).
- Another port of HyperBowl (I do have the license for that).
- Online multiplayer HyperBowl (an artist told me he could help and sent me a screenshot of a menu screen with a Multiplayer button added).
- HyperBowl racing.
