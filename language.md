## Language App Ideas

- An app that says hello in all languages.
- An app that shows all the elaborate terminology for Chinese relatives (e.g. father's younger brother)
- An app that teaches endangered languages.
- An app that shows the evolution of Chinese characteres.
- An app that teaches sign language, using camera gesture recognition.
- An RPG for language instruction - go out and buy/barter weapons, assemble a team, etc. in a foreign land with a foreign language (just like I had to figure out how to order food in the company cafeteria when I worked in Hong Kong).
