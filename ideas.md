## Game Ideas

- A Bass Pro fishing game (I don't remember any details of this proposition, but I'm pretty sure getting a Bass Pro license is the important part).
- Another port of HyperBowl (I do have the license for that).
- Online multiplayer HyperBowl (an artist told me he could help and sent me a screenshot of a menu screen with a Multiplayer button added).
- HyperBowl racing.

## App Ideas

- An Uber of apartment moving.
- An Uber of (fill in the blank).
- Call blocking based on area codes (most of my spam calls are from a place I lived in ten years ago).
- A mobile version of Nendo (a 3D modeler with a minimal user interface).
- A comic book authoring system, something that supports more than just reproducing the static pages of a regular comic books, i.e. audio, video...(there used to be a slick Unity-based package, and I know Bay Raitt was working on a VR comic book system).

## Social Media

- LinkedIn, but project-based instead of company-based, so you link with project collaborators instead of company colleagues.
- An app where instead of starting off with the feed of the world jammed down your throat, you start off with everyone blocked, and you invite people into your circle (or circles). Like how Facebook started out, but without the turning evil part. And more blocking, who cares about number of likes, I want to see number of blocks, see (and copy) a person's block list, recursively block someone and their followers and their followers...

## Virtual Worlds

- Educational services in a virtual world (student and teacher avatars, in-world classrooms, private student-teacher chats...)
- Same for health.

## Other

- Ideas that were so unoriginal or vague that I still cannot remember them.
